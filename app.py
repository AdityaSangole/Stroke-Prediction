    st.title("Working of the Stroke Prediction Model üß†")
    st.write("""
        Our stroke prediction model is designed to assess the risk of stroke by analyzing several key features related 
        to your health and lifestyle. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:

        ### Input Stage: Collecting Your Health Data üìù
        When you enter your details into the app, the model collects information on 10 key features that play an 
        important role in determining your stroke risk...

        ### Prediction Stage: Making Sense of the Data üìä
        Once all the data is collected, our model processes the information by encoding categorical features to convert 
        them into a numerical format that the machine learning model can understand.

        ### Output Stage: Stroke Prediction üéØ
        Finally, the processed data is fed into a machine learning model, which predicts whether you are at risk of experiencing a stroke based on the patterns it has learned from historical medical data.

        ### Model Performance Metrics üìà
        - **Train Score**: {train_score:.2f}
        - **Test Score**: {test_score:.2f}
        - **Precision Score**: {precision_score:.2f}
        - **Recall Score**: {recall_score:.2f}
        - **F1 Score**: {f1_score:.2f}

        ### Confusion Matrix üìä
        The confusion matrix helps us understand how well the model is performing. In this case, the matrix is as follows:
        ```
        [[945,  55],
         [ 65, 935]]
        ```
        - True Positives (TP): 935 (correctly predicted strokes)
        - True Negatives (TN): 945 (correctly predicted no strokes)
        - False Positives (FP): 55 (predicted strokes that did not occur)
        - False Negatives (FN): 65 (missed strokes that did occur)

        A higher number of true positives and true negatives indicates better model performance.

# About Page

    st.write("""
        Welcome to **StrokeSniffer**, your personalized health companion! This app is designed to help predict the likelihood
        of experiencing a stroke based on critical health and lifestyle factors.

        Leveraging the power of **machine learning**, StrokeSniffer analyzes your inputs‚Äîlike age, gender, medical history, and 
        more‚Äîto provide a prediction. Our model is trained on real medical data to make accurate, data-driven assessments 
        of stroke risk.

        However, it‚Äôs important to remember that StrokeSniffer is a **preventive tool** meant to offer guidance, not a 
        diagnostic conclusion. While it provides valuable insights into your health risks, it is always recommended to 
        consult a healthcare professional for an expert evaluation and advice.

        By combining **AI technology** and **user-friendly design**, we aim to empower individuals to take proactive steps 
        toward maintaining their health and well-being. Early detection and awareness can make all the difference when it 
        comes to stroke prevention.

        Whether you‚Äôre looking for peace of mind or a prompt to visit your doctor, StrokeSniffer is here to help you on your 
        health journey. Remember‚Äîyour health is your greatest asset, and prevention is the best cure.

        Take control of your health, and let StrokeSniffer be your guide!
